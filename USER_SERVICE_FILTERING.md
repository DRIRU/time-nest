# User Service Filtering Feature

## Overview
This feature ensures that users do not see their own services when browsing the services page. This prevents confusion and provides a better user experience by showing only services they can actually book or interact with.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Updated Services API Endpoint
**File:** `backend/app/api/endpoints/services.py`

Added `exclude_creator_id` parameter to the `get_services` endpoint:

```python
@router.get("/", response_model=List[ServiceResponse])
def get_services(
    skip: int = 0, 
    limit: int = 100, 
    category: str = None,
    creator_id: int = None,
    exclude_creator_id: int = None,  # New parameter
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Exclude services by specific creator_id if provided
    if exclude_creator_id:
        query = query.filter(Service.creator_id != exclude_creator_id)
```

#### 2. New Frontend API Function
**File:** `frontend/lib/database-services.js`

Added `getAllServicesExcludingUser` function:

```javascript
export async function getAllServicesExcludingUser(options = {}) {
  // Build query with exclude_creator_id parameter
  if (options.excludeCreatorId) {
    queryParams.append("exclude_creator_id", options.excludeCreatorId);
  }
  // ... rest of implementation
}
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Services Page Client Component
**File:** `frontend/components/services/services-page-client.jsx`

- Added `useAuth` hook to access current user
- Added filtering logic to exclude current user's services
- Updated dependency arrays to include `currentUser`

#### 2. Main Services Page Component
**File:** `frontend/components/services/services-page.jsx`

- Added `useAuth` hook to access current user
- Added filtering logic to exclude current user's services
- Updated dependency arrays to include `currentUser`

#### 3. Mock Data Updates
**File:** `frontend/lib/services-data.js`

- Added `creator_id` fields to mock services for testing
- Updated all functions to use the new `MOCK_SERVICES_FINAL` array

### Key Features

#### 1. Real-time Filtering
- Services are filtered when the component mounts
- Filtering is re-applied when user authentication state changes
- Filtering works with all existing search and filter functionality

#### 2. Robust Error Handling
- Graceful handling when user is not authenticated
- Fallback behavior when creator_id is not available
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

#### 3. Performance Optimized
- Filtering happens client-side for immediate response
- Backend filtering available for future optimization
- Minimal impact on existing codebase

### Data Flow

1. **User logs in** → Auth context updates with user information
2. **User navigates to services page** → Services are loaded from backend
3. **Services are displayed** → Frontend filters out services where `creator_id` matches current user's `user_id`
4. **User applies filters** → Custom filtering is applied on top of user exclusion
5. **User logs out** → All services are shown (no filtering applied)

### Testing

#### Manual Testing
1. Create a service as a logged-in user
2. Navigate to the services page
3. Verify that your own service is not displayed
4. Log out and verify that all services are displayed
5. Log in as a different user and verify the service is visible

#### Automated Testing
Run the test functions in the browser console:
```javascript
// Run individual tests
testUserServiceFiltering();
testUserServiceFilteringMultipleUsers();
logServiceDetails();
```

### Database Schema Considerations

The feature relies on the `creator_id` field in the Service model:
- `creator_id` (Integer): Foreign key to User table
- Used to identify the service creator
- Required for filtering logic

### Future Enhancements

1. **Admin Override**: Allow admin users to see all services
2. **Service Management**: Add "My Services" section in user dashboard
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Add more sophisticated filtering options
4. **Analytics**: Track user engagement with filtered vs unfiltered views

### Configuration

No additional configuration is required. The feature is automatically enabled when:
- User is authenticated (has valid token)
- User has `user_id` in the auth context
- Services have `creator_id` field populated

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **Services still showing for current user**
   - Check if `creator_id` is properly set in service data
   - Verify user authentication state
   - Check console for filtering errors

2. **No services displaying**
   - Verify backend is returning services
   - Check if filtering is too restrictive
   - Ensure user_id is properly set

3. **Filtering not working after login**
   - Check if auth context is updating
   - Verify useEffect dependencies include `currentUser`
   - Clear browser cache if needed

#### Debug Commands

```javascript
// Check current user state
console.log("Current user:", JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("currentUser")));

// Check service data
console.log("All services:", filterServices());

// Test filtering manually
const currentUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("currentUser"));
const filtered = filterServices().filter(s => s.creator_id !== currentUser?.user_id);
console.log("Filtered services:", filtered);
```

### Security Considerations

- Filtering is performed client-side for UX but should not be relied upon for security
- Backend endpoints should enforce proper authorization
- Service ownership should be verified server-side for any modification operations
- User authentication should be validated before any service operations

## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

The feature is fully implemented and ready for use. Users will no longer see their own services when browsing the services page, providing a cleaner and more relevant browsing experience.
